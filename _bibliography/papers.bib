  abstract={Let's say that "I fully know that p" if I know that p, I know that I know that p, I know that I know that I know that p, and so on. Let's say that "I partially know that p" if I know that p but I don't fully know that p. What, if anything, do I fully know? What, if anything, do I partially know? One response in the literature is that I fully know everything that I know; partial knowledge is impossible. This response is in tension with a plausible margin-for-error principle on knowledge. A different response in the literature is that I don't fully know anything; everything that I know, I partially know. Recently, Goldstein (2024, forthcoming) defended a third view, according to which I fully know some things and I partially know other things. While this seems plausible, Goldstein's account is based on denying the margin-for-error principle. In this paper, I show that the possibility of both full knowledge and partial knowledge is consistent with the margin-for-error principle. I also argue that the resulting picture of knowledge is well-motivated.}

  title={Knowledge by choice},
  author={Fiat, Yonathan},
  year={Under review},
  abstract={It's natural to think that we can know depends only on what is given to us; on our evidence, for example. In this paper, I argue that this is false. It also depends on our choices. I argue that our choices can change what would be an amazing coincidence, and that typically we can know that amazing coincidences don't happen. This paper explores three applications of this idea. First, it suggests a new solution to the lottery paradox. Second, it gives us a new understanding of how we can get inductive knowledge. And finally, it shines a new light on significance testing, one of the most important statistical practices in science.}

  title={Escaping Zeno's Shadow: A defense of common knowledge},
  author={Fiat, Yonathan},
  year={Under review},
  abstract={Two agents commonly know that p if they both know that p, they both know that they both know that p, they both know that they both that they both know that p, etc. Common knowledge can in principle arise in many kinds of situations. In this paper, I focus on two extreme kinds of cases: cases where agents can only reach common knowledge by communication, and cases where agents cannot communicate and still apparently have common knowledge. I examine three skeptical arguments to the conclusion that common knowledge is impossible in those cases, and argue that they fail because they make the Zeno Fallacy: the inference from the fact that something needs infinitely many steps to the conclusion that it is impossible to do.}
