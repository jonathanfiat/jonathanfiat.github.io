  title={Knowledge to Infinity: Full knowledge and the margin-for-error principle},
  author={Fiat, Yonathan},
  year={Under review},
  abstract={I fully know that $p$ if I know that $p$, I know that I know that $p$, I know that I know that I know that $p$, and so on ad infinitum. What, if anything, do I fully know? One response in the literature is that I fully know everything I know. This response is in tension with the plausible margin-for-error principle on knowledge. A different response in the literature is nothing: I don't fully know anything. Recently, Goldstein (2024, forthcoming) defended a third view, according to which I fully know some things, but not everything that I know. This response is also in tension the margin-for-error principle.
    
  In this paper, I show that the possibility of full knowledge is consistent with the margin-for-error principle. We can have full knowledge even if the margin-for-error principle is true. I argue that the resulting picture of knowledge is well-motivated.}

  title={Escaping Zeno's Shadow: A defense of common knowledge},
  author={Fiat, Yonathan},
  year={Under review},
  abstract={Two agents commonly know that $p$ if they both know that $p$, they both know that they both know that $p$, they both know that they both that they both know that $p$, etc. Common knowledge can in principle arise in many kinds of situations. In this paper, I focus on two extreme kinds of cases: cases where agents can only reach common knowledge by communication, and cases where agents cannot communicate and still apparently have common knowledge. I examine three skeptical arguments to the conclusion that common knowledge is impossible in those cases, and argue that they fail because they make the Zeno Fallacy: the inference from the fact that something needs infinitely many steps to the conclusion that it is impossible to do.}

  title={Attitudes to Risk when Choosing for Others},
  author={Fiat, Yonathan and Nissan-Rozen, Ittay},
  year={Under review},
  abstract={This paper provides a defense of Parfit's principle: when a person's preferences are unknown, it is wrong to take, on their behalf, some of the risks that they could rationally choose to take. We argue that rejecting the principle leads to a false conclusion when deciding for more than one person. To do that, we prove a pair of theorems that show that all and only risk-seeking attitudes can lead to this result.}
