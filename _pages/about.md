I'm a philosophy PhD candidate in the [MIT Department of Linguistics and Philosophy](https://philosophy.mit.edu/) under the advising of [Roger White](https://philosophy.mit.edu/white/). I work mainly in epistemology, especially in connection to the philosophy of science and to decision theory.

I spend most of my time thinking about how what we *do* affects what we can know. As an easy example, consider randomization: every practitioner knows that the most important feature of clinical trials is to randomize the participants between a *test group* and a *control group*. But from a certain perspective, it is a bit puzzling: randomization is something we do, not something we observe.
