Here’s a common picture of the ideal epistemic agent. He is tied to a chair without being able to move. His eyes are forcefully held open. And he is drugged such that he has no plans, hopes, or even thoughts. His entire being is about responding to what comes in.

Everyone can agree that such an agent is not going to know a lot. We know as much as we do partly because we look for evidence. But, according to most mainstream views in contemporary epistemology, this is an aside, an unfortunate complication that can be safely ignored. According to this mainstream position, the ideal epistemic agent would be like the one I just described, but attached so a more active agent who would be in charge of gathering the evidence. This way, our perfect epistemic agent won’t be sullied by such things.

There is a different possible picture of ideal epistemic agent. Imagine a rat in a maze with a hidden piece of cheese. She runs down the different routes and sniffs the air. She forms and follows a plan. She comes up with hypotheses and tests them. The rat is admirable in many ways. She is likely to achieve her goal of getting the cheese. She is a good inquirer. She works to get knowledge. She doesn’t passively attempt to make the most of what finds its way to her.

This project is about developing this second picture of ideal epistemic agents. I think that we can make progress on many of the traditional questions of epistemology when we adopt this kind of picture. I also think that when we adopt this picture, we can make better sense of our scientific practices.

For example, in "A predictivist account of significance testing" I offer a new justification for _significance testing_, one of the most important practices in science, by appealing to the idea that when we make a successful prediction, it makes a difference.

<!-- {% cite fiatBandits %} -->

In "Bandits of knowledge" I argue that to keep our knowledge, we must actively maintain it. I appeal to the famous [multi-armed bandit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit) problem, and argue that it teaches us that we can lose knowledge simply by failing to maintain it by looking for evidence.

<!-- {% cite fiatKnowledgeByChoice %} -->

In "Knowledge by choice" I argue that in order to avoid skepticism, we must accept that what we know depend on our choices, and not only on what's _given_ to us. I show that this insight helps solve the lottery paradox, and it explains our inductive knowledge and our statistical practices.
