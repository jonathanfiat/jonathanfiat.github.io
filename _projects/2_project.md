Epistemic logic is the study of some of the fundamental properties of knowledge and related concepts. For example, one question that bothered philosophers for years: it is true that if I know something, I also know that I know it?

<!-- {% cite fiatKnowledgeToInfinity %}, -->

In "Knowledge to Infinity: Full knowledge and the margin-for-error principle" I accept the position that sometimes, I know something without knowing that I know it. But I argue that sometimes, I know something, and I know that I know it, and I know that I know that I know it, and ... I show how we can have infinitely many levels of knowledge, without assuming that whenever we know something, we know that we know it.


<!-- {% cite fiatZenosShadow %} -->

In "Escaping Zeno's shadow: A defense of common knowledge", I use this idea to argue that sometimes, we have common knowledge. A group commonly know something if all its members know it, and they all know that they all know it, and they all know that they all know that they all know it, and ... This idea has been used extensively in discussions of rationality, but philosophers have been skeptical of it. I show that there is no reason to think that common knowledge is impossible.
